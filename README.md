# Note from Developer
Hello. I'd like to inform people interested in this project (has 12 stars as of now) that I would not be available much
for at least a month due to real life academic reasons. Yes! I'm 16 and I have a crucial academic year to go through!
This being said , I'd be fairly inactive on github / reddit from **XX-0X-2020** and cannot say anything about my return.
Hence , if some issue arises , you can either - <br><br>
1. Submit the issue and I will review and fix it. It can take a fair amount of time and I can't promise anything.
2. Read the code and fix the issue yourself. After which , you can submit a pull request.
3. Fix the issue and send me corrections using [email](https://wraithm17@gmail.com)
